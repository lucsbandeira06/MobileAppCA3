#Report#

On this assignment we were required to fetch data from an api using Json in Android Studio. It is a very interesting concept and very useful in many applications. Though I understood what the requirements for this project were, I have concluded that this assignment was particularly hard to me as I could not make it functional despite having made some progress.

I was able to fetch data from the url "https://api.github.com/users/lucsbandeira06" which information can be found on the logcat tab, however the application could not be built because there was no adapter attached even though I created the adapter and called it.

Despite of the poor outcome of this project, I feel like I was one step away from solving the issue.
